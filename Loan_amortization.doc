How to calculate a loan amortization schedule if you know your monthly payment:

Starting in month one, take the total amount of the loan and multiply it by the interest rate on the loan. 
Then for a loan with monthly repayments, divide the result by 12 to get your monthly interest. 
Subtract the interest from the total monthly payment, and the remaining amount is what goes toward principal. 
For month two, do the same thing, except start with the remaining principal balance from month one rather than the original amount of the loan. 
By the end of the set loan term, your principal should be at zero.

Take a simple example: Say you have a 30-year mortgage for $240,000 at a 5% interest rate that carries a monthly payment of $1,288. 
In month one, you'd take $240,000 and multiply it by 5% to get $12,000. Divide that by 12, and you'd have $1,000 in interest for your first monthly payment. 
The remaining $288 goes toward paying down principal.

For month two, your outstanding principal balance is $240,000 minus $288, or $239,712. 
Multiply that by 5% and divide by 12, and you get a slightly smaller amount -- $998.80 -- going toward interest. 
Gradually over the ensuing months, less money will go toward interest, and your principal balance will get whittled down faster and faster. 
By month 360, you owe just $5 in interest, and the remaining $1,283 pays off the balance in full.


Calculating an amortization schedule if you don't know your payment:

Sometimes, when you're looking at taking out a loan, all you know is how much you want to borrow and what the rate will be. 
In that case, the first step will be to figure out what the monthly payment will be. 
Then you can follow the steps above to calculate the amortization schedule.

There are a couple ways to go about it. 
The simplest is to use a calculator that gives you the ability to input your loan amount, interest rate, and repayment term. 
For instance, our mortgage calculator will give you a monthly payment on a home loan. You can also use it to figure out payments for other types of loans simply by changing the terms and removing any estimates for home expenses.

If you're a do-it-yourselfer, you can also use an Excel spreadsheet to come up with the payment. 
The PMT function gives you the payment based on the interest rate, number of payments, and principal balance for the loan. 
For instance, to calculate the monthly payment in the example above, you could set an Excel cell to =PMT(5%/12,360,240000). 
It would give you the $1,288 figure you saw in that example.
